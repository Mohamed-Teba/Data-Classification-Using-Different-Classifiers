# 📊 Data Classification Using Different Classifiers 🧠

Welcome to the **Data Classification Using Different Classifiers** project! 🚀 This project explores a variety of machine learning classifiers to categorize data into meaningful classes. From logistic regression to random forests, this system compares the performance of multiple algorithms to achieve accurate classification. 🌟

---

## 🌟 Overview

Classification is a fundamental task in machine learning, with applications in spam detection, medical diagnosis, and more. This project implements and evaluates multiple classifiers (e.g., Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, Naive Bayes) to classify datasets effectively. It builds on the author's previous work, such as the [ANN for Classification and Regression](https://github.com/Mohamed-Teba/ANN-for-Classification-and-Regression) and [Mail Spam Detector](https://github.com/Mohamed-Teba/Mail-Spam-Detector), focusing on traditional machine learning techniques. 🧮
